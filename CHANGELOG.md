## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-31

Supermind v4: Unified Skill Engine — ground-up rebuild combining GSD's execution infrastructure with Superpowers' behavioral discipline into a single native system. OpenSpec removed. Superpowers plugin dependency removed. Methodology skills forked from obra/superpowers (MIT), adapted for executor injection model.

### Added
- **Complexity router** (`/supermind`): auto-detects task scope, routes to `/quick` or `/project` mode with escape hatch
- **Quick Mode** (`/quick`): single-executor path for small tasks — stateless, with automatic skill injection
- **Project Mode** (`/project`): six-phase lifecycle orchestrator — discuss, research, plan, execute (waves), verify, ship
- **Executor engine** (`cli/lib/executor.js`): fresh-context subagent execution with `buildTaskPacket()`, `buildWavePlan()` (topological sort), `executeTask()`, and `SKILL_MAP` injection
- **Agent prompt templates** (`cli/lib/agents.js`): 4 researcher types, planner, plan-checker, debugger, verifier, code-reviewer
- **Planning state management** (`cli/lib/planning.js`): `.planning/` directory CRUD with path-safe operations
- **Context monitor** (`hooks/context-monitor.js`): two-hook bridge — warnings at 35%/25% remaining context
- **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): dual npm + plugin distribution with registry in `installed_plugins.json`
- **10 methodology skills** forked from obra/superpowers (MIT): anti-rationalization, verification-before-completion, TDD, systematic-debugging, brainstorming, code-review, writing-plans, executing-plans, using-git-worktrees, finishing-branches
- **Agent definitions** (`agents/code-reviewer.md`): review-only subagent for verify phase
- **Doctor v2** (`cli/commands/doctor.js`): comprehensive health checks for all v4 subsystems — skills (15/15), agents (1/1), hooks (8/8 with registration verification), context monitor, plugin manifest, executor engine modules, safety layer (blocklist model), `.planning/` integrity, and version marker. Organized into sections with overall health summary.

### Changed
- **bash-permissions.js**: rewritten from allowlist to blocklist model — everything auto-approved by default, only ~15 dangerous patterns blocklisted
- **Statusline**: redesigned two-line layout with context usage bar, wave progress, and executor count
- **CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md**: complete rewrites for v4 architecture
- Hook count: 8 (was 7 in v3.0). Skill count: 15 (was 7 in v3.0). Agent count: 1 (new).

### Removed
- OpenSpec integration (4 skills, CLI command, lib module)
- Third-party plugin dependencies (superpowers, claude-md-management, frontend-design, ui-ux-pro-max, pr-review-toolkit, security-guidance, elements-of-style)
- `cli/lib/plugins.js` module

### Breaking
- Major version bump: v3.x → v4.0.0
- OpenSpec skills and CLI commands removed
- Plugin dependency model replaced with native methodology skills
- Doctor command output format changed (sectioned layout with subsystem checks)

### Credits
- Methodology skills forked from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (MIT) by Jesse Vincent and the Prime Radiant team
- Execution architecture inspired by [gsd-build/get-shit-done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) (MIT)

## [3.19.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md**: Complete rewrite for v4 unified engine architecture. Added methodology skills table with injection targets, State Management section for `.planning/` directory, Distribution section for dual npm + plugin. Removed PR Review Workflow section (was referencing pr-review-toolkit plugin). Reorganized Skill System into Entry Points and Methodology Skills subsections. Updated all hook descriptions to match current implementations.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete rewrite for v4. Added architecture diagram showing complexity router → executor engine → safety layer → infrastructure. File Index now organized by category (CLI, Libraries, Hooks, Skills, Other) with accurate line counts. Added executor engine data flow (buildTaskPacket, buildWavePlan, executeTask). Added `.planning/` state management to data flow diagram. Added path-safety and executor injection model to Key Patterns.
- **README.md**: Rewritten for v4. New tagline reflecting unified skill engine identity. Added Two Modes section (/quick and /project). Expanded What's Included table covering all component categories. Added vendor skill CLI commands. Added Credits section attributing obra/superpowers (MIT) and gsd-build/get-shit-done (MIT).
- **package.json**: Updated description to match v4 identity.
- Sub-project 5.3 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design.

## [3.18.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Enhanced statusline** (`hooks/statusline-command.js`): redesigned two-line layout with three new indicators
  - **Context usage bar**: compact `[████████░░]` visual indicator alongside percentage, color-coded by remaining capacity — green (>50%), yellow (25-50%), red (<25%). Reads from `~/.claude/context-metrics.json` (written by the same hook for the context monitor). Moved from line 2 to line 1 alongside identity and branch.
  - **Wave progress**: when Project Mode is active with `.planning/` state, displays `▸ Wave 2/4 · 3/5 tasks` showing current wave, total waves, and task completion. Parses `roadmap.md` for active phase and `progress.md` for task entries. Only displayed when `.planning/` exists with active progress.
  - **Active executor count**: subagent display renamed from "agents" to "executors" to match v4 terminology. Shows `⠛ 2 executors: desc1, desc2` with braille spinner.
  - **Revised line layout**: Line 1 = user@host | model | branch | context bar. Line 2 = token counts | wave progress | executors | cost. Path moved off line 1 to make room for context bar.
  - All new indicators degrade gracefully: no `.planning/` → no wave progress, no context data → no bar, no executors → no count.
  - Sub-project 5.2 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design.

## [3.17.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): Supermind now registers as a Claude Code plugin during install, enabling future `/plugin update supermind` support and marketplace discovery. Dual distribution — npm package for CLI + infrastructure, plugin manifest for skill/hook/agent discovery.
- **Plugin module** (`cli/lib/plugin.js`): handles plugin registration in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, manifest generation with auto-versioning from `package.json`, cache directory management at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local/supermind/<version>/`, and stale version cleanup on update. Forward-looking registration stub — content delivered via traditional `~/.claude/` paths.
- **Doctor check**: plugin registration health check verifies `supermind@local` entry exists in `installed_plugins.json`.
- Updated install (7 steps, was 6), update (6 steps, was 5), and uninstall commands to manage plugin lifecycle.
- `.claude-plugin/` added to npm `files` array for package distribution.
- Sub-project 5.1 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design.

## [3.16.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Supermind complexity router** (`skills/supermind/SKILL.md`): replaced the static parent namespace skill with a complexity router — the `/supermind` entry point that auto-detects task scope and routes to `/quick` or `/project` mode
  - Analyzes user prompts against quick signals (fix, rename, typo, single-file scope, unambiguous) and project signals (build, implement, create, multi-file scope, ambiguous)
  - Announces routing decision with escape hatch; proceeds immediately (user can override at any time)
  - Supports all explicit overrides (`quick: <task>`, `/quick`, `/project`) and composable flags from both modes
  - Edge cases: non-task prompts skip routing; active `.planning/` sessions resume Project Mode; ambiguous tasks default to quick
  - Preserves `/supermind-init` and `/supermind-living-docs` as sub-commands
  - Sub-project 4.3 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design

## [3.15.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Project Mode skill** (`skills/project/SKILL.md`): full six-phase lifecycle orchestrator — discuss, research, plan, execute (waves), verify, ship. Coordinates the entire development lifecycle for features, refactors, new systems, and multi-file changes. Phase 1 (Discuss): invokes brainstorming skill with interactive or `--assumptions` mode, saves design to `.planning/phases/phase-N/discussion.md` via `writeDiscussion()`. Phase 2 (Research): spawns 4 parallel researcher subagents (`RESEARCHER_PROMPTS.stackResearcher/featureResearcher/architectureResearcher/pitfallResearcher` from `cli/lib/agents.js`), saves outputs via `writeResearch()`. Phase 3 (Plan): invokes writing-plans skill, generates atomic task plans via `PLANNER_PROMPT`, validates with `PLAN_CHECKER_PROMPT` (max 3 iterations), saves via `writePlan()`/`writeTask()`. Phase 4 (Execute): invokes executing-plans skill, builds wave plan via `buildWavePlan()`, dispatches parallel executors via `buildTaskPacket()`/`executeTask()` with automatic `SKILL_MAP` injection, tracks progress via `writeProgress()`, handles failures with `DEBUGGER_PROMPT` (one retry). Phase 5 (Verify): invokes code-review skill, spawns code-reviewer via `CODE_REVIEWER_PROMPT` and verifier via `VERIFIER_PROMPT`, fix loop (max 3 rounds). Phase 6 (Ship): invokes finishing-branches skill, pushes branch, opens PR with auto-generated body from `.planning/` state. Composable flags: `--skip-discuss`, `--skip-research`, `--assumptions`, `--max-parallel N`. Orchestrator never writes code — only coordinates subagents. Sub-project 4.2 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design.
- Updated `KNOWN_SKILLS` in `cli/lib/skills.js` to include `project`
- Skill count: 15 directories (was 14)

## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Quick Mode skill** (`skills/quick/SKILL.md`): single-executor mode for small, clear tasks — bug fixes, renames, config changes, adding tests. Activated by `quick:` prefix or `/quick` invocation. Parses task description to detect type (fix-bug, write-test, refactor, write-feature), builds a task packet via `buildTaskPacket()` from `cli/lib/executor.js` with automatic skill injection via `SKILL_MAP`, spawns a single fresh-context executor subagent, and reports results. Supports composable flags: `--with-research` (pre-dispatch researcher via `RESEARCHER_PROMPTS.featureResearcher` from `cli/lib/agents.js`) and `--with-discuss` (2-3 clarifying questions before dispatch). Worktree decision based on file count (>2-3 files → worktree via `executeTask({ useWorktree: true })`). Fully stateless — no `.planning/` directory. Sub-project 4.1 of Supermind v4 Unified Engine design.
- Updated `KNOWN_SKILLS` in `cli/lib/skills.js` to include `quick`
- Skill count: 14 directories (was 13)

Includes task spec format (id, type, dependsOn, acceptance criteria, verification), wave grouping via dependency graph, plan-checker self-review loop (max 3 iterations), and `.planning/` state output (plan.md + individual task specs). Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- **Executing-plans skill** (`skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md`): wave-based plan execution with progress tracking and failure handling for the orchestrator Execute phase. Coordinates fresh-context executor dispatch via `buildTaskPacket`/`executeTask`/`buildWavePlan` from `executor.js`, respects `maxParallel` config (default 3), tracks progress in `.planning/phases/phase-N/progress.md`, handles single-task retry, multi-failure pause, and dependency cascade skip. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- **Finishing-branches skill** (`skills/finishing-branches/SKILL.md`): Ship phase handler — push branch, open PR, or keep/discard branch with worktree cleanup. Three options: Create PR (default, auto-generates description from `.planning/` state), Keep Branch (preserves worktree), Discard (requires typed confirmation). Never merges to main/master, never force pushes. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- Updated `KNOWN_SKILLS` in `cli/lib/skills.js` to include `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `finishing-branches`

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Git worktree skill** (`skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md`): automated worktree creation with safety checks for isolated development — used by executors when task scope warrants it (>2-3 files, logic changes, parallel execution). Covers .gitignore verification, dependency auto-detection (npm/yarn/pnpm, cargo, pip, go), baseline test verification, and completion reporting. Executors create and commit in worktrees; orchestrator handles merge and cleanup. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- Skill count: 10 directories (was 9)

## [3.11.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Code review skill** (`skills/code-review/SKILL.md`): structured code review methodology for the Verify phase — six evaluation criteria (spec compliance, correctness, test coverage, security, maintainability, consistency), three-tier issue classification (critical/important/suggestion), structured output format with verdicts (PASS/NEEDS FIXES/FAIL), and anti-performative-agreement guidance for receiving review feedback. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- **Agent definitions** (`agents/`): new directory for subagent prompt templates installed to `~/.claude/agents/`. First agent: `code-reviewer.md` — review-only subagent that evaluates diffs against plans and coding standards.
- **`CODE_REVIEWER_PROMPT`** in `cli/lib/agents.js`: agent prompt template for spawning code reviewer subagents in the Verify phase. Takes diff, plan, and optional task spec context.
- Agent install infrastructure: `installAgents()`, `removeAgents()`, `getAgentFiles()` in `cli/lib/skills.js`; `PATHS.agentsDir` in platform.js; wired into install, update, uninstall, and doctor commands.
- Skill count: 9 directories (was 8). Agent count: 1 definition.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Brainstorming skill** (`skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`): pre-implementation design exploration with two modes — Interactive (default, one-question-at-a-time clarification) and Assumptions (analyzes codebase and presents assumptions for user correction, triggered by `--assumptions` flag). Used by orchestrator during Discuss phase of Project Mode. Includes scope detection (flags multi-system requests for decomposition), 2-3 approach proposals with trade-offs, section-by-section design approval, and structured output to `.planning/phases/phase-N/discussion.md`. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT), assumptions mode inspired by gsd-build/get-shit-done (MIT).
- Skill count: 8 directories (was 7)

## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Systematic debugging skill** (`skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`): four-phase root-cause debugging methodology — injected into `fix-bug` executors via `SKILL_MAP`.

Includes anti-patterns table, escalation rule (stop after 3 failed fixes), and verification checklist. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- Skill count: 7 directories (was 6)

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **TDD skill** (`skills/tdd/SKILL.md`): strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR test-driven development methodology — injected into `write-feature` and `write-test` executors via `SKILL_MAP`. Enforces "no production code without a failing test first" iron law.

### Added
- **Anti-rationalization skill** (`skills/anti-rationalization/SKILL.md`): blocks common LLM rationalizations for skipping steps — injected into all executors via `SKILL_MAP`. Includes 8 rationalization/rebuttal pairs covering tests, verification, investigation, and config changes. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- **Verification-before-completion skill** (`skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`): requires command output evidence before any executor can report task completion. Defines what counts as verification (test output, compiler output, behavior demos) vs. what doesn't (assertions, beliefs, code reading). Includes mandatory completion report template. Forked from obra/superpowers (MIT).
- Skill count: 5 directories (was 3)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Executor engine** (`cli/lib/executor.js`): core runtime engine for Project Mode's fresh-context subagent execution
  - `buildTaskPacket(task, options)` — assembles self-contained task packets with spec, context, injected methodology skills, and completion contract
  - `executeTask(taskPacket, options)` — builds structured execution requests (prompt + metadata) for the orchestrator to pass to the Agent tool
  - `buildWavePlan(tasks)` — topological sort of tasks by dependency graph into parallel execution waves; throws on circular dependencies
  - `formatWaveProgress(wavePlan, results)` — renders Markdown progress table (wave/task/status/commit)
  - `getSkillContent(skillName, projectRoot)` — reads SKILL.md from `~/.claude/skills/` with project-level fallback
  - `SKILL_MAP` — maps task types to methodology skill sets (write-feature→TDD+verification+anti-rationalization, fix-bug→debugging+verification+anti-rationalization, etc.)
  - All paths validated via `safeJoin` pattern; skill names validated with regex
- **Agent prompt templates** (`cli/lib/agents.js`): specialized agent prompts for Project Mode orchestration

  - `isActive(projectRoot)` — check if any phases are non-completed
  - All paths validated via `safeJoin` pattern (no path traversal); filenames validated with `safeFilenameSegment`
- **Session-start hook**: `.planning/` awareness — detects active planning sessions and reports phase, wave, and task progress on session start

### Changed
- Session-start hook (`session-start.js`): all `path.join` calls migrated to `safeJoin` helper for path traversal protection

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Context monitor hook** (`context-monitor.js`): two-hook bridge pattern that monitors context window usage and injects advisory warnings when context gets heavy
  - At 35% remaining: advisory — "Consider wrapping up current task or spawning a fresh executor"
  - At 25% remaining: warning — "Commit current work now. Remaining tasks should run in fresh subagents"
  - Below 25%: repeats warning every 5th tool call to avoid spam
  - Reads metrics from `~/.claude/context-metrics.json` written by the statusline hook
  - Tracks warning state in `~/.claude/context-monitor-state.json` to avoid duplicate warnings
  - Silent when metrics are stale (>60s) or missing
